# Audio Book App

A draft of an app to order audibook files.

This app has been for educational reasons  as part of the Udacity Google Developer Challenge Scholarship focusing on the use of array lists and multiple activities.

The icons used in this app are mainly from Game-Icons.net (http://game-icons.net/).

The books mentioned in this book are no real books, the authors no real persons (so some names might hold slight referrences to well established works of the respective genre).
